We've been taking photos, and not really sharing them. These photos have gone into some or other storage, whether it's been Google cloud, 

a portable hard-disk or O365 storage.

So, I thought it would be a good idea to create a website and house these photos there instead! Use some github storage.

I've used a pretty fast framework "Hugo" to build the site which should make it quite a responsive site. There are a lot of photos to load.


I'm working through all this 'other storage' to come up with some decent pictures.


Creating the website would allow for people all over the world to view these photos too, and download them if they wanted to.

I thought I'd add a map to the give people an idea , a sense of the area, and just add a bunch of photos from that particular experience.

I also built a tag cloud which should help with some of the content management.

There are 3 sections on the navigation bar, Random, photo gallery and Our home. Under these 3 sections there are various sub-sections which 
contain relevant content. The site is a work in progress as photos will be added as they are either recovered or captured. So. I'm working 
to get the historic photos added, and then new photos will be added as we experience new things! 


A lot of these photos have been taken with a mobile phone (The cameras on mobile phones are so good these days, 
and to be honest, my current phone takes better photos than my Sony mirror less camera!)



So here we go.

Hope you like the photos!

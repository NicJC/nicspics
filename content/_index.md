We've been taking photos, and not really sharing them. These photos have gone into some or other storage whether it be Google cloud, 

or some or other sort of storage.

So, I thought it would be a good idea to create a website and house these photos there instead! Use some github storage.

And, allow people to see some of these places we've been to.

Creating the website would allow for people all over the world to view these photos, and download them if they so wished to.

I thought I'd add a map to the give people an idea , a sense of the area, and just add a bunch of photos from that particular experience.

So here we go!

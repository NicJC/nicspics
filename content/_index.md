We've been taking photos, and not really sharing them. These photos have gone into some or other storage, whether it's be Google cloud, 

a portable hard-disk or O365 storage.

So, I thought it would be a good idea to create a website and house these photos there instead! Use some github storage.

I working through all this 'other storage' to come up with some decent pictures.



Creating the website would allow for people all over the world to view these photos too, and download them if they so wished to.

I thought I'd add a map to the give people an idea , a sense of the area, and just add a bunch of photos from that particular experience.

So here we go!

A lot of these photos have been taken with a mobile phone (The cameras on mobile phones are so good these days, 
and to be honest, my current phone takes better photos than my Sony mirror less camera!)

Hope you like the photos!

        We've been taking photos, and not really sharing them. These photos have gone into some or other storage, whether it's google cloud, a portable hard-disk or some other type of storage.
    </p>
    <p>
        So, I thought it would be a good idea to create a website and house these photos there instead, so that other people could see these photos too!
    </p>     
    <p>
        I'm working through all this 'storage' to come up with some decent pictures.
    </p>
    <p>
        I've added an inter-active map to the give people an idea, a sense of the area, and just add a bunch of photos from that particular experience.
    </p>
    <p>
        I also built a tag cloud which should help with some of the content management.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are 3 sections on the navigation bar:
         Random, photo gallery and Our home. 
         Under these 3 sections there are various sub-sections which contain relevant content. The site is a work in progress as photos will be added as they are either recovered or captured. So. I'm working to get the historic photos added, and then new photos will be added as we experience new things!
    </p>
    <p>
        A lot of these photos have been taken with a mobile phone (The cameras on mobile phones are so good these days, and to be honest, my current phone takes better photos than my Sony mirror-less camera!)
    </p>
    <p>
        So here we go.
    </p>
    <p>
        Hope you like the photos!

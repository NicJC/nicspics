Nelson was a really cool trip, we had quite a lot of driving, and the hills were quite treacherous, but as always it was worth it!

<p>
Use the map below to scroll around Nelson, we went to Motueka where we stayed a few nights, had some great walks, and there was also a really nice restaurant that we went to!

We were also at Able Tasman for some walking and awesome site seeing!
